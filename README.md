# ATM-Training-Simulator
In this Repository you will find my ATM Training Simulator Project using Python 


💳 ATM Training Simulator
The ATM Training Simulator is a Python console-based application that simulates basic banking operations—depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking the account balance. Designed with educational clarity and modular architecture, it demonstrates several core Python programming concepts while providing a realistic user experience.

📂 Project Structure

ATM_Training_Simulator/
│
├── ATMOperationDemo.py # Main driver that manages user input and flow
├── ATMMenu.py # Displays formatted menu interface
├── ATMExceptions.py # Defines custom exception classes
├── BankOperations.py # Performs deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry

♦️ 🚀 What This Project Does

💠📥 Allows users to deposit money

💠💸 Enables withdrawals with minimum balance enforcement

💠📊 Shows current account balance

💠 ❌ Rejects invalid amounts (e.g. negative, zero, or non-numeric)

💠💬 Provides helpful error messages using custom exception handling

♦️🧠 Python Concepts Used
This project demonstrates a wide range of beginner-to-intermediate Python topics:

✅ 1. Modular Programming
Each file focuses on a specific task (menu, exceptions, operations, main logic).
Encourages clean separation of responsibilities.

🛠️ 2. Functions
Each banking operation is encapsulated in a function (deposit(), withdraw(), check_balance()).
Makes the code reusable and readable.

🎯 3. Global Variables
Used to maintain the account_balance across functions.

🔁 4. Loops
while True: keeps the app running until the user chooses to exit.

🧮 5. Conditional Logic
Uses the modern match-case structure to handle user choices (Python 3.10+).

🚨 6. Exception Handling
Catches both built-in and custom exceptions for user-friendly feedback.

🚧 7. Custom Exception Classes
Tailored error classes give precise control and clarity.

🧾 8. User Input & Type Conversion
Uses input() and safely converts strings to floats/integers.

🧹 9. Code Cleanliness & Readability
Descriptive variable names like account_balance, deposit_amount, and user_choice.

♦️ Consistent formatting and clear messages for user interaction.
💻 How to Run
Ensure all four .py files are in the same folder.

Run the main driver file using any Python interpreter (Python 3.10+ recommended):
python ATMOperationDemo.py
